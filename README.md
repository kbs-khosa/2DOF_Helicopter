# 2DOF_Helicopter
# 2 parts of the file show two different controllers, one for pitch channel while other for the yaw channel
# Since there are only two controllers, so the system simulates 2D flight. In the first part of the project, a SISO discrete-time controller is designed for the pitch angle. Thus in designing the pitch channel, we ignore the coupling between the two channel and treat the yaw channel as disturbance and vice-versa.
